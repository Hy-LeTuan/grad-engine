# Grad Engine

**Grad Engine** is a lightweight, from-scratch implementation of an **automatic differentiation engine** coupled with a **computational graph visualizer**. The project aims to mimic the core components that power modern neural network training while also providing users a special viewpoint into how different components play together to create a coherent engine.

Inspired by PyTorchâ€™s design, this project builds the foundations of automatic differentiation. While simplified compared to production systems, it captures the essential mechanics of backpropagation and dynamic graph construction.

This project is part of my deeper dive into the internals of deep learning frameworks, aiming to build both understanding and tooling by learning from popular highly optimized frameworks.
