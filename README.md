# Grad Engine

**Grad Engine** is a lightweight, from-scratch implementation of an **autograd engine** and a **computational graph**, the core components that power modern neural network training.

Inspired by PyTorchâ€™s design, this project builds the foundations of automatic differentiation. While simplified compared to production systems, it captures the essential mechanics of backpropagation and dynamic graph construction.

This project is part of my deeper dive into the internals of deep learning frameworks, aiming to build both understanding and tooling by learning from popular highly optimized frameworks.
